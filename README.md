# Problem Statement--

We may have only few seconds to save a life when we are in an emergency. Is anything that we can do in an emergency until help arrives? We should do because the only person we may have to depend on is ourselves. First aid is the emergency care given to a victim of injury or sudden illness before professional medical help arrives. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a lifesaving method or technique useful in many emergencies such as heart attack which someone's breathing or heartbeat has stopped. It is method of combining chest compressions with rescue breathing to maintain a flow of oxygen-rich blood to the brain while the heart is not working. 

In Malaysia, the number one killer in terms of diseases and health problems is heart attack. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the total number of deaths in Malaysia resulted from coronary heart disease was at 22,701 in 2010. This makes to about 22.18 percentages of the total deaths in the country. Heart disease is different from stroke which is the second top killer in Malaysia. So, it can make different when everybody know how to do Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 

Imagine one day that we find our friend lying on the floor and unconscious. We have no idea how long he has been there and then run to call the ambulance. While the ambulance is on their way that person is helpless and we can’t do anything for help him. Wouldn’t you want to possess the skills needed to help save him? Therefore learning CPR skills are important and it could mean the difference between life and death. Furthermore, most popular injuries happen among teenagers and high school students were sling. When our friends break their arms outside, first we have to do is getting the person to support the injured arm with his hand. Next, take the lower end of the bandage up over the hand forearm and tie it in the hollow just above the collarbone. Then, pin the point near the elbow or twist and tuck it in. First aid skill and knowledge is really important in our daily life.

# Functional requirements->

In software engineering, a functional requirement defines a function of a software system or its component. A function is described as a set of inputs, the behaviour, and outputs (see also software).
Functional requirements may be calculations, technical details, data manipulation and processing, and other specific functionality that define what a system is supposed to accomplish. Behavioural requirements describing all the cases where the system uses the functional requirements are captured in use cases.

# Objective-> 

Everybody should know how to manage first aid because it is one of the most valuable skills we can ever have. However, not all of us would endeavor to have first aid certification and most would probably think that they don’t need to be certified. After all, common situations like a child falling down would just entail a mother cleaning up the wound and applying a plaster to the wound. But these are just the very basic first aid techniques that everyone knows how to do. 

The main objective for the author to develop this application:-- 
* To develop an application that giving first aid knowledge to the user by using this application. 
* To provide global positioning system (GPS) to the nearest hospital. 
* To test the user knowledge first aid by provide test for some situation in the application. 
At this point, it makes sense for everyone to learn first aid skills and require having this knowledge so we can help each other. All we need to do is take advantage of them.
